**r_archx** is an experimental active vision daemon engineered for the Arch Linux and Hyprland ecosystem.

Moving beyond passive operating systems, r_archx leverages local-first inference and multimodal context injection to create a system that sees, understands, and anticipates user workflow.

## // Core Architecture
- **Active Observation:** Real-time visual context analysis using lightweight local models.
- **System Autonomy:** Python-based IPC control for automated Wayland interactions.
- **Privacy First:** All inference runs locally on the edge; no data leaves the host machine.

## // Roadmap
- [ ] [v0.1] Environment Setup & Repository Initialization
- [ ] [v0.2] Wayland IPC Bridge (Hyprland)
- [ ] [v0.3] Basic OCR Context Loop
